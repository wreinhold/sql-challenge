# sql-challenge

This was completed for an assignment through the UNC Data Science Bootcamp. In this challenge, I used pgAdmin 4 to import 6 different CSV files and perform various queries.

I started the assignment by analyzing the CSV files in order to create an ERD png depiction of what the tables would look like in the final database.

Then, I created the tables for imports in the sql-challenge_import.sql file within the EmployeeSQL folder and then imported the data from the data folder.

Next, I followed the instructions to perform various queries on the database. I used various joins, conditions, and functions like group by and order by to complete this. You can find the queries within sql-challenge_queries.sql in the EmployeeSQL folder.
